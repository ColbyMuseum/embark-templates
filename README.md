# Colby College's JSON export templates and scripts for the Embark WebKiosk
This repo contains SHTML templates for the Embark WebKiosk for exporting JSON and a python script to clean, normalize, and legalize the JSON. used by the Colby College Museum of Art to export JSON from the EmbARK WebKiosk. AFAIK, table and field names in Embark are all tightly coupled to the individual database, so we're publishing these more as a guide than something plug-and-play.

The JSON export from these shims/scripts are up in [Colby's repo](https://github.com/ColbyMuseum/MuseumLOD).)
